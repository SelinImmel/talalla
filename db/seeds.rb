In this class everyone practices at their own pace, with assistance and adjustment from the teacher. The support is given to each student individually but within a group of people practicing together. Each student memorizes the sequence of asana (postures) to follow and new poses are progressively added to it when a student is ready. In Mysore style one begins learning slowly, respecting the limitations of the body and focusing on the breathing. The time of the class is the time it takes you to practice. Your first practice may only be about 30-45 min, while for someone more experienced it can take up to 1 h and 45 minutes. The entry to Mysore class is flexible, people start and finish at different times.'
